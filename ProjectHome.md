**mod\_pagespeed is an open-source Apache module which automatically applies web performance best practices to pages, and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow.**

mod\_pagespeed is built on [PageSpeed Optimization Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/psol), deployed across 100,000+ web-sites, and provided by popular hosting and CDN providers such as DreamHost, GoDaddy, EdgeCast, and others. There are 40+ available  optimizations filters, which include:

  * Image optimization, compression, and resizing
  * CSS & JavaScript concatenation, minification, and inlining
  * Cache extension, domain sharding, and domain rewriting
  * Deferred loading of JavaScript and image resources
  * and [many others](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/config_filters)...
